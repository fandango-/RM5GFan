Add quick settings tiles to switch the cooling fan & LED Strip on/off on the Red Magic 5G outside game space.

Caveat: the LED strip QS tile toggles both cooling fan and LED strip at the same time due to how Nubia has implemented the mechanism, to only enable the LED strip, first activate the LED strip tile and then de-activate the Cooling fan tile.
