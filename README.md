 Add quick settings tiles to toggle the useful features (like cooling fan, led strip, refresh rate, nfc, etc.) on the Red Magic 5G outside game space.
 
NOTE: you need to enable root access for the app to work. After installing the app, go to magisk manager -> menu -> superuser -> enable the toggle for the fan app.
